Descriptive Analytics on SPARCS 2022 Data


## Objective:
In this assignment, you will load a portion of the 2022 SPARCS (Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System) de-identified data. You will perform basic descriptive statistics and create visualizations based on the data. This will allow you to explore healthcare trends, patient demographics, and hospital performance metrics. 


**Summary Report**:
   - Write a brief summary of your findings in the notebook:
     - What is the average length of stay?
     - How does the total cost vary by age group or type of admission?
     - Any noticeable trends in admissions or charges?
    
     This homework was extremely hard for me to understand. I didn't know how to generate the graphs and I had to seek additional and outside help. Due to incorrect code, I was unable to create any charts and plots.
